# Things to note about this Project :

It's customized using tailwind-Css and some basic CSS .

It's only front-end so no saving for the context through reloading and backup information, there is no authentication happening just a plain site.

You can run this after deleting the package-lock.json and installing node_modules so your version won't fall behind the react, react-dom version, to install the node_modules just run in your directory

```
npm install
```
# After installing the packages

Write down in your terminal:

npm run start 
```
